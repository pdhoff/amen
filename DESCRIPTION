Title: Additive and Multiplicative Effects Models for Networks and Relational Data
Version: 1.1
Author: Peter Hoff, Bailey Fosdick, Alex Volfovsky, Yanjun He
Description: Analysis of network and relational data using additive and
 multiplicative effects (AME) models. The basic model includes
 regression terms, the covariance structure of the social relations model
 (Warner, Kenny and Stoto (1979), Wong (1982)), and multiplicative factor
 models (Hoff(2009)). Four different link functions accommodate different
 relational data structures, including binary/network data (bin), normal
 relational data (nrm), ordinal relational data (ord) and data from
 fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn).  Several of these link functions are
 discussed in Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and Stovel (2013). Development of this
 software was supported in part by NICHD grant R01HD067509.
