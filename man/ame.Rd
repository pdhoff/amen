\description{
An MCMC routine providing a fit to an additive and multiplicative effects
(AME) regression model to relational data of various types
}
\details{
This command provides posterior inference for parameters in AME models of
relational data, assuming one of six possible data types/models:

"nrm": A normal AME model.

"tob": A tobit AME model. 

"bin": A binary probit AME model.

"ord": An ordinal probit AME model. An intercept is not identifiable in this
model.

"cbin": An AME model for censored binary data.  The value of 'odmax'
specifies the maximum number of links each row may have.

"frn": An AME model for fixed rank nomination networks. A higher value of
the rank indicates a stronger relationship. The value of 'odmax' specifies
the maximum number of links each row may have.

"rrl": An AME model based on the row ranks. This is appropriate if the
relationships across rows are not directly comparable in terms of scale. An
intercept, row random effects and row regression effects are not estimable
for this model.

data(YX_frn) 
fit<-ame(YX_frn$Y,YX_frn$X,burn=5,nscan=5,odens=1,family="frn")
# you should run the Markov chain much longer than this
