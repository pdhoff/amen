\format{A list consisting of a socioarray \code{Y} and a nodal attribute matrix \code{X}. 

The dyadic variables in \code{Y} include three binary networks: advice, friendship
and co-worker status. 

The categorical nodal attributes in \code{X} are coded as follows: 
\itemize{
\item status (1=partner, 2=associate)
\item office (1=Boston, 2=Hartford, 3=Providence) 
\item practice (1=litigation, 2=corporate) 
\item law school (1=Harvard or Yale, 2=UConn, 3=other)  
 }
\code{seniority} and \code{age} are given in years, and \code{female} is 
a binary indicator.}
